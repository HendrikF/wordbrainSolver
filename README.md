# WordBrain solver

This __python 3__ script was build to solve the puzzles given by the __Android app "Wordbrain" by "MAG Interactive"__.

It achieves that by extracting words from the database of http://dict.cc and combining all given characters.

Because of their license, I am not able to include the database in this Repo and you have to download it by yourself.

First execute `extract.py` to extract a unique list of words from the translation database.

Then use `solve.py` to solve the puzzles using the prepared list of words.

I am running this under Ubuntu, so I can not tell, whether it works on Windows.

Additionally the script might focus on German words.
